\section{Experience}
\begin{entrylist}
\entry
{2019–2021}
{Scientist, Microsoft Research, Mixed Reality \& AI Lab}
{Cambridge, United Kingdom}
{I worked on a parametric 3D face model that powered multiple projects across the team. I built the training, evaluation, and visualization infrastructure, developed new features, fixed bugs,
and lead a research effort that doubled the average fit quality. I~worked with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and NumPy.\\}

\entry
{2018–2019}
{AI Resident, Microsoft Research}
{Cambridge, United Kingdom}
{I worked on deep generative models for novel view synthesis and on deep reinforcement learning for video games. Both projects involved
formulating research questions, implementing and extending existing methods, and presenting the results at internal conferences. I used Pytorch, C\#, and OpenCV.\\}

\entry
{2016–2018}
{Data Scientist, Cliqz}
{Munich, Germany}
{I~implemented an information retrieval model combining LSTM networks and CNNs. I~also built a pipeline for
collecting, processing, and visualizing telemetry data. I worked with Python, TensorFlow, and Spark.\\}

\entry
{2015–2016}
{Software Engineer, Nokia Networks}
{Kraków, Poland}
{I was responsible for implementing new features for the LTE control plane, as well as designing unit tests, system component tests,
and integration tests. I~used C++ and Python.\\}

\entry
{2014–2015}
{Research Intern, AGH Signal Processing Group}
{Kraków, Poland}
{I conducted a comparative analysis of language models in automatic speech recognition and published the results in a conference paper.\\}
